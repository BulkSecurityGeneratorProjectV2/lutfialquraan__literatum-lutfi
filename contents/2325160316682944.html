<p id="N65666">Early last summer, we, the staff of a pediatric endocrinology clinic, found ourselves earning extra steps on our pedometer apps by walking more frequently to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) from our Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic. We noticed an increase in these trips to see our pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), defined as the presence of ketones in blood or urine and serum bicarbonate less than or equal to 15 mmol/L or pH less than 7.3.</p>
<p id="N65668">At first the increase was subtle, and each individual case was managed with extra family education and a short stay. However, when we started compiling the PICU admission data, we realized several families were sharing the same reason for the tumble into DKA. It sounded something like this: &ldquo;I guess the pump wasn&rsquo;t working and we didn&rsquo;t realize he/she was getting sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="N65670">From January 2011 to June 2015, about 30% (n = 35) of our DKA admissions were caused by insulin pump malfunction or lack of action by patients and families in response to signs of interrupted insulin delivery.</p>

<h2 class="main-title">Digging Into Our DKA Admissions</h2>
<p id="N65676">As providers and educators, we wanted to optimize DKA prevention for our patients and help minimize the need for costly comorbidity treatment with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. An outpatient chart review showed provider-patient education on safe pumping practices was given and documented. However, the patient/family perceived a lack of knowledge about a pump back-up plan (as stated during the admission).</p>
<p id="N65678">We asked patients what led up to their admission&mdash;how did it all start? Usually the patient responded that he or she noticed a rise in blood glucose (BG) and used the insulin pump correction factor bolus with no success. Here are the common steps on the journey to DKA:</p>
<div class="list">
<a id="list1-2325160316682944">
<!-- named anchor --></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p id="N65684">Step 1: BG is above 300 mg/dL. Use the pump to give a correction factor bolus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65687">Step 2: Don&rsquo;t recheck the BG . . . or check and see a high BG and give another correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65690">Step 3: Don&rsquo;t check ketones. Don&rsquo;t do a site change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65693">Step 4: Think it&rsquo;s a flu bug causing stomachache and vomiting. Go back to bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65696">Step 5: Can&rsquo;t keep fluids down and get dehydrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65699">Step 6: Don&rsquo;t call the clinic for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65702">Step 7: Hopefully, go to the Emergency Room for care and admission to PICU.</p>

<h2 class="main-title">A Commitment to Quality Improvement</h2>
<p id="N65708">As a result of these observations, a quality improvement project was born. We learned that most of our DKA admissions were related to new onset diabetes. These were patients we had not yet met, and we likely had little chance of preventing PICU admissions in these patients. However, 30% of our DKA admissions occurred in patients known to us, receiving insulin via insulin pump, and not correctly recognizing interruptions in insulin delivery and/or not taking appropriate actions to address the interruptions.</p>

<p class="first" id="N65712">We learned that most of our DKA admissions were related to new onset diabetes.</p>
</div>
</p>
<p id="N65714">Knowing that DKA due to insulin pump malfunction can be prevented, the increasing expense of inpatient ICU care, and the risks to the child, our staff moved forward. The team included a certified diabetes educator (CDE), pediatric endocrinologists, pediatric endocrinology fellows, and nursing support staff.</p>
<p id="N65716">A literature review did not identify any existing educational intervention data, but several articles pointed out this problem and suggested the need for intervention (see reference list). According to research led by Tieder, a cost analysis of inpatient admissions varied widely. Using mean data from multiple organizations, it was reasoned that if PICU admission days decreased, the cost avoidance could be over $3074 per admission. Also, eliminating additional follow-on costs in non-PICU rooms might add cost savings of over $2500 per admission.</p>

</div>
</p>
<p id="N65722">The project started with pediatric patients 2 to 23 years of age in the outpatient clinic. All patients had T1D diagnosed at least 6 months prior to starting on the pump. After reviewing Bolderman&rsquo;s book on insulin pumps, we developed a written back-up plan to provide instructions on monitoring for signs of impending DKA, giving insulin by injection at specific doses, and trouble-shooting the pump (<a href="#fig1-2325160316682944">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p id="N65746">The intervention included a pretest that analyzed the knowledge base of insulin pump patients or parents/guardians, an intervention in the form of the written insulin pump back-up plan, and a posttest at a follow-up visit (<a href="#fig2-2325160316682944">Figure 2</a>). Individualized counseling was provided with the written plan, and it was documented in the medical record.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p id="N65776">Step 1: Write it down. Prepare an insulin pump back-up plan when well. Take a smartphone picture of the plan to use anywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65779">Step 2: If BG is &gt;300 mg/dL, check urine or blood ketones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65782">Step 3: Use correction factor, drink water, set alarm to recheck BG in 1 to 2 hours. Follow the written plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N65785">Step 4: If highs continue, have any symptoms, or positive ketones, then dose insulin with a needle (pen or syringe) and change the pump site.</p>

<h2 class="main-title">Reducing Admissions With Back-Up Plans</h2>
<p id="N65797">After implementing written insulin pump back-up plans in June 2015, a decrease in inpatient admissions and an increase in the knowledge of DKA prevention was observed. Admission data show only 1 DKA admission related to pump use since the project implementation. This patient, however, had not received the intervention. Including the nonintervention admission, there was a 75% reduction in admissions for pump-related DKA.</p>
<p id="N65799">A total of 42 pretests and 30 posttests were completed and analyzed during the 6-month data gathering timeframe. Patients recalling having an insulin pump back-up plan increased from 43% to 90% at the follow-up visit (<i>P</i> = .001), and correctly listing the proper back-up long-acting insulin dosage increased from 37% to 70% (<i>P</i> = .008) (<a href="#fig3-2325160316682944">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<p class="first" id="N65818">Pre/posttest comparison.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p id="N65822">As part of the quality improvement project, ongoing suggestions and feedback were utilized to evaluate the outcomes. Patient and professional feedback of the insulin pump back-up plan has been positive. Families are glad for the defined action plan. The health care system is taking note of the quality and financial benefits. Cost avoidance as compared to the previous 6 months would be estimated at $12&thinsp;296 based on 4 fewer admissions to the PICU (not including non-PICU bed days).</p>

<h2 class="main-title">Conclusion</h2>
<p id="N65832">While the staff may not be accumulating so many steps on pedometer apps now, they are pleased with the ability to catch knowledge deficits and prevent admissions. After successful use of a written plan and educational intervention as a quality improvement project, the information and tools will be shared in hopes of improving the outcomes of all T1D children.&emsp;<sup>n</sup>
